In this module, we are examining crowdfunding data from companies attempting to raise money. We analyze whether the campaigns are successful and gather additional information about the companies from the data.

Afterward, we imported the data into pgAdmin and ran queries to ensure proper importation. Finally, we created an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) based on our findings
